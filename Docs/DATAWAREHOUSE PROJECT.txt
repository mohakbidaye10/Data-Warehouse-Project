DATAWAREHOUSE PROJECT

1. Built the architecture using the medallion approach.(bronze, silver, gold)
   Used draw.io to build the flow diagram of the architecture

2. BRONZE LAYER:
	Data ingestion from the csv files to the bronze layer
	Raw, unprocessed data loaded into the bronze layer
	Carry out a full load (truncate and insert)
	
	A) Creating DDL statements:
	Data profiling : exploring the data to identify column names and datatypes
			i.e. looking into the dataset csv files.
 	Created tables from the dataset files from two diff Source Systems. 
	i.e. 'source_crm' and 'source_erp'

	B) Conducted bulk insert and full load of the data from the source to the data 	warehouse.

	C) Wrote a stored procedure for the bulk insert script. added try and catch blocks and 	found load durations for the batch and each table

	D) Committed the code to the GitHub repo.

3. SILVER LAYER:
	A) Exploring and understanding data
	Created diagrams after looking into the tables to understand table relationships better
	i) crm_cust_info related to crm_sales_details

	ii) crm_cust_info is related to erp_cust_az12

	iii)crm_prod_info related to crm_sales_details
	
	iv) crm_sales_details related to crm_cust_info and crm_prod_details

	v) erp_loc_a101 related to crm_cust_info

	vi) erp_px_cat_g1v2 related to crm_prod_info
